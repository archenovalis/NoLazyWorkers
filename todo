## bugs

packager only grabbed 4 from a shelf when taking product to a packaging station, 16 were available. he then stood in front of the packaging station doing nothing. since there are now 4 in the station, he should have tried to switch the jars (used when product >= 5) for baggies. since there are no baggies, should have tried to add more of the same product.
